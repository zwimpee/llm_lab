# Zwimpee's LLM Lab
## Overview
This repository is an open-source reimplementation of the internal tool I created for Artisight under the same name.

While also being open-source, this implementation is also considerably more lightweight and user friendly than the version currently being used to support product development, and thus it serves simply as a place for me to quickly test out and evaluate ideas for experiments related to modifying different parts of the model architecture, or playing around with different datasets, etc.

### Setup
To install this project, run 
```bash
pip install -e .
```
